When two people are collaboratively working on a Node.js backend project using GitHub, here’s a step-by-step guide from project initialization to smooth collaboration:

---

### 🧱 **Step 1: Project Initialization (by one person)**

1. **Create a folder and initialize a Node.js project:**

   ```bash
   mkdir node-backend-project
   cd node-backend-project
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Initialize Git:**

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Create `.gitignore`:**
   Add files/folders to ignore (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env`):

   ```txt
   node_modules/
   .env
   ```

4. **Create initial files:**
   (e.g., `index.js`, `package.json`, etc.)

5. **Make initial commit:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

6. **Create a repository on GitHub**
   Go to GitHub → Create New Repository (private or public).

7. **Add remote and push code:**

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   git push -u origin master  # or main
   ```

### 🤝 **Step 2: Collaboration Setup**

#### 👤 Person 1 (Owner):

1. Go to the GitHub repo → **Settings → Collaborators** → Add Person 2 by GitHub username/email.

#### 👤 Person 2 (Collaborator):

2. **Accept the invite** from GitHub notifications or email.

3. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name
   ```

### 🔁 **Step 3: Daily Workflow for Both Developers**

> Tip: Always **pull before you push** to avoid conflicts.

#### ✅ 1. Create a New Branch (for new feature/fix):

```bash
git checkout -b feature/login
```

#### ✅ 2. Make Changes and Commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added login API"
```

#### ✅ 3. Push Branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin feature/login
```

#### ✅ 4. Create a Pull Request (PR):

* Go to GitHub → Compare & Pull Request → Add title and description → Submit PR.

#### ✅ 5. Review and Merge (either dev can do this):

* Reviewer checks code.
* If approved, merge the PR into `main`.

#### ✅ 6. Update Local Repository:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### 🔄 **Step 4: Handling Conflicts**

If two people change the same file, a conflict may arise during merge. Git will show conflict markers in files like:

```txt
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your code
=======
Their code
>>>>>>> branch-name
```

Manually resolve and then:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
git push origin main
```

---

### 🛠️ **Step 5: Best Practices for Collaboration**

* ✅ Use clear branch names: `feature/auth`, `fix/bug-123`
* ✅ Use meaningful commit messages.
* ✅ Never commit sensitive data (like `.env`).
* ✅ Use `.env.example` to show environment variable structure.
* ✅ Use issues and pull requests to track tasks and progress.
